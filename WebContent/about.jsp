			We are a start-up company creating a web based application called Fit Together, which will provide a 
			matchmaking service for those looking for a one-time or long-term workout partner, based on personal preferences. 
			Currently, we aim to target university students who want to find someone to workout with; a key demographic that generally 
			strives for a healthy lifestyle but many encounters difficulty due to factors such as lack of motivation and free time that 
			coincides with their friends. Based on this demand, The Fit Together web application fosters an online community of users with 
			fitness interests that empowers each other to stay healthy through exercise.

			Our strategy is to target University of Toronto St. George Campus students first, then broaden 
			our scope to form partnerships with other schools as well as local gyms.
			Students at the St. George campus can visit the following websites for more information about 
			fitness at the University of Toronto.

			<br>
			Currently 43% undergrads report needing more physical activity [1].
			However, each year 67% of people with gym memberships do not use them, whether it be that the
			membership was purchased or automatically given by their university [2]. The good news is that
			people have a 94% success rate when exercising with a partner [3]. This is exactly where Fit Together will fit in.
			With 30,000 undergrads at the University of Toronto St. George campus, we believe that we will be able to provide fitness partners for 
			students, therefore encouraging a high success rate for those who want to get more physical activity.

	<b>Overview</b><br>
	Upon registering, members will create a personalized profile by entering key information about their fitness level, 
	workout interests as well as their time preferences. The system will run an algorithm to match this user with others 
	who are the most compatible based on certain attributes. The matching process then provides each pair their 
	partner¡¯s information, giving them the choice to connect with each other and potentially work out.
